# Blockchain in Go

My attempt to learn blockchain technology by implementing a simple blockchain in Go.

To use with devcontainer, you need to have Docker/Podman installed. It is aimed at using NeoVim and Devpods.

```shell
devpod up --ide none .
```

It will install NeoVim, Go extensions and set up the environment for you.
